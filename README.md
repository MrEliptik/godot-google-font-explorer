# Google Fonts Explorer for Godot

A simple addon/plugin for godot which allows you to browse all google fonts and download any of them to your project without leaving godot.

The easiest installation is trout the godot asset library, but you may also clone/download this repository and unpack it into your project.

Once enabled, you will have a new tab to view the fonts. Just click away and test them through the panel to the right. Use the save button on the bottom of the panel to download the font to the root directory of your project. You can put it wherever you like after that and even remove the plugin!

All fonts and the tree of available fonts are extracted from [https://github.com/google/fonts](https://github.com/google/fonts). Always check for the font's individual license just to make sure!
